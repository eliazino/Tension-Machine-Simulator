# Tension-Machine-Simulator
----------------------------
This machine lets user simulate behaviour of different Engineering material under Tensional force.
-Language of Implementation `Java`
**The Program has the following classes**
1. graphGUI This program lets you plot graphs of stress-strain and load-extension
2. SimulationGUI this simulate the behaviour of the material under tensional force
3. ParamCalculator handles the calculations. [if anything is wrong, start from here]
